				<th>Decides how thick your font will be, how thick the lines of the font are. Use to bold text or some fonts allow you to use 100-800 (in increments of 100) to decide how thick the font is</th>
				<th>Simply increases the spacing between lines in a paragraph. Not used so often apart from 1.5 or 2</th>
				<th>Controls how text is aligned, whether it's to the left center or right. </th>
				<th>Used to remove decoration from links mainly but can also be used to put a line above, through or below text.</th>

	<p id="creepster">Don't you see how great this is? You, you are a... Jesse look at me. You... are a blowfish. A blowfish! Think about it. Small in stature, not swift, not cunning. Easy prey for predators but the blowfish has a secret weapon doesn't he. Doesn't he? What does the blowfish do, Jesse. What does the blowfish do? The blowfish puffs up, okay?</p>

	<p id="finger">The blowfish puffs himself up four, five times larger than normal and why? Why does he do that? So that it makes him intimidating, that's why. Intimidating! So that the other, scarier fish are scared off. And that's you! You are a blowfish. You see it's just all an illusion. You see it's... it's nothing but air. Now... who messes with the blowfish, Jesse? You're damn right. You are a blowfish. Say it again. Say it like you mean it. You're a BLOWFISH! </p>
